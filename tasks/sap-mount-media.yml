# This module creates the mountpoint if it doesn't exist.
# As such I need to provide  owner & group.
# This can change when something is mounted and the setup fails in a second run
# So as a quick fix I put ignore_errors: yes, so that it can safely fail in second run.
#  if something goes wrong in the first run it's fine, the mount will fail
#  TODO: Create some better way to ensure the install dir
